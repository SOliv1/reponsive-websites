#Introduction to Responsive websites

This is a responsive web-design basic layout.  
We are introduced to a webdesign where the layout responds to every device.
We test it out on the browser by increasing or decreasing the screen sizes live
on the screen.
We look at CSS media queries that help us target the different screen sizes.
From a mobile, desktop to large screen desktop device, we are shown how to enhance  
the webdesign on the phone or desktop device.  
This is a lead up to the mobile first module
which focusses on mobile devices as the primary concern.
Designs are increased or decreased as a fluid layout. 
The CSS properties thus avoids fixed values of the elements and this relates 
to the relative sizes of the viewport.
